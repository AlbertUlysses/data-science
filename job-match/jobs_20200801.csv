<p>
Atlis Motor Vehicles was born in founder Mark’s garage, ignited by curiosity and personal motivation. Mark’s goal: take his energy-guzzling diesel pickup and convert it into an electric truck. Early on, it was just Mark, his truck, and long hours spent in the solitude of his garage. He leveraged his engineering background and brought in colleagues who are experts in various fields—power tech, batteries, automotive dynamics, etc.—to design a solution that solves the biggest pain points in the electric vehicle market today. Together, they sought to disrupt the status quo and to discover just how far they can take it. The result: the XT Pickup. It’s not just a better electric vehicle; it’s not just a better pickup truck; it’s the foundation for an entirely new approach to electric vehicles.</p><br/>

Our mission is a big one: we will change the world with a better alternative. We will build something that matters, not just something to play the game. We will solve problems that are key to our customers' success. We will not be afraid of big challenges.

<p>
Atlis Motor Vehicles was born in founder Mark’s garage, ignited by curiosity and personal motivation. Mark’s goal: take his energy-guzzling diesel pickup and convert it into an electric truck. Early on, it was just Mark, his truck and long hours spent in the solitude of his garage. He leveraged his engineering background and brought in colleagues who are experts in various fields—power tech, batteries, automotive dynamics, etc.—to design a solution that solves the biggest pain points in the electric vehicle market today. Together, they sought to disrupt the status quo, and to discover just how far they can take it. The result: the XT Pickup. It’s not just a better electric vehicle; it’s not just a better pickup truck; it’s the foundation for an entirely new approach to electric vehicles.</p><br/>
<p></p>
<p>
Our mission is a big one: we will change the world with a better alternative. We will build something that matters, not just something to play the game. We will solve problems that are key to our customers' success. We will not be afraid of big challenges. There is a lot of work to do, and we're looking for optimistic problem-solvers to help us get there.</p><br/>

Instead of exhausting all of our time, let me close with this. I completely understand the hesitation to work for an appraisal company as opposed to being an independent contractor. We have all heard the stories of the appraisal companies taking advantage of appraisers and cutting fee splits because of late reports, cutting volume and not allowing appraisers to work to generate a livable income, and reporting appraisers who no longer work with them for spite. This is not me and this is not my company. As a former United States Marine, I take my integrity very seriously and will always be fair and honest.

<b>THE ROLE</b><br/>

You will join a team of successful operating executives and entrepreneurs with extensive M&amp;A experience, and who have created billions in value. Do you have a strong senior financial executive background with extensive deal making experience? This is a rare opportunity for you because unlike most funds, we place more value in operational experience than the school you attended. Working in concert with our team, you will oversee all aspects of the investment cycle with particular emphasis on transactional deal activities and assessment of new investments. You will have control of the entire investment process from sourcing to distribution. Along the acquisition journey, you’ll gain access to our advisors, distribution connections, proprietary operational tools, and to our value creation team with whom you’ll collaborate on post transaction, value-enhancing activities.</div><div><br/>

You’ve dealt with pitfalls, but you never stop believing and always find a way to win. You have a bias toward hands on management, a sense of urgency, demonstrate strong leadership and communication skills, and the ability to motivate teams while managing multiple projects. Not only have you succeeded but you’ve had big wins! And you continually use those learnings to guide strategic input and leadership on decision making which could have included evaluating potential alliances, and strategic add-on acquisitions. You are detail-oriented and demonstrate the ability to quickly understand the primary drivers of a variety of businesses, and you can quickly analyze and interpret complex financial data. Lastly, you know the uniqueness of working at a growing Private Equity company as a lead investment executive.<br/>

<div><div><h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Culture</b></h3><div><ul><li>
We’re not just engineering systems, we’re engineering a company. Preserving our culture is the most important thing to us as we scale. It’s the way we come together to find the best solutions, and how we hold ourselves accountable to achieving our vision: delivering success for our customers and meaningful experiences for our people.</li><div></div><br/>
<li>
Do Something Big: The future promises a lot—the Internet of Everything, smart connected cities, transparent markets, virtual medicine—but these advances require more than what's possible with conventional solutions. We’ve developed a new way to build distributed systems. For over a decade, we’ve used it to build complex trading systems for the world’s largest financial institutions, and now we’re starting to solve real-time problems across every industry.</li><div></div><br/>
<li>
Blaze Your Own Trail: We’re at an exciting stage—small but growing fast. There are unprecedented opportunities to learn and lead right away. Whatever your goals, from heads-down development to collaborating with customers, from executing and streamlining our business to leading teams, from innovating new products to opening up new industries, or a bit of “all of the above"", we’ll work together to get you there. There is no one path. You’ll have the freedom to follow your interests as they evolve.</li><div></div><br/>
<li>
Solve Hard Problems: The engineering we do is complex—thousands of globally distributed components, vast amounts of fast-moving shared data, continuous real-time analysis and execution, always-on mission-critical performance. It ordinarily takes years to solve these problems (think aerospace or flight control) but that’s not an option for us. Our fintech executes hundreds of billions of dollars in trades each day, so there’s huge value in launching ideas fast. We invent smarter designs and smarter ways to develop and test, so we can innovate in quick cycles without compromising the exacting requirements inherent to the systems we build.</li><div></div><br/>
<li>
Be Greater Together: We tackle problems no one could solve alone, so we’re here to learn from each other. Each insight is a springboard for the next. We encourage disagreement to achieve a greater outcome. But solving hard problems is only part of the equation—we hire people who inspire us and enjoy working together. The result is a team that truly “clicks”.</li><div></div><br/>
<li>
Do the Right Thing: Building a healthy, lasting company starts from the inside out. Our progressive policies and practices foster transparency, integrity, openness, and forward thinking. We are deeply committed to building a company that empowers people, enables them to thrive throughout their careers, and do big things here.</li></ul></div></div></div>

<p>
At Carvana, we sell cars, but we're not salespeople. Since 2013, we've been making it our mission to change the way people buy cars. We saw a huge problem with how much it can suck to buy a car the traditional way, so we committed ourselves to tackling one of the largest, yet-to-be-disrupted markets in the world – the $1T per year U.S. car market (yes, that's $Trillion with a ""T"").</p>
<p>
With the ability to search thousands of vehicles from our expansive inventory, to high-resolution 360° photographs of our vehicles' interior and exterior, to real-time financing and the ability to complete contracts without visiting the back room of a dealership, we provide a seamless, online car buying experience for consumers that can be completed from their desktop or mobile device. All our vehicles are inspected and reconditioned based on our 150-point certification checklist and come with a 7-day return policy. We also operate our own logistics network to deliver cars to customers as soon as the next day, as well as offer customer pick-up at our state-of-the-art Car Vending Machine locations (yes, you read that right). By putting customer satisfaction at the core of our business, we've built a no-pressure, no-haggle online car buying experience that save our customers time and money.</p>
<p>
For more information on Carvana, take a look at our company introduction video.</p>
<p><b>
WORKING AT CARVANA YOU WILL NOTICE THAT...</b></p>
<p>
You'll need to be a great communicator, a brand ambassador, and possess the know how to get the job done.</p><br/>
<p></p>
<p>
We expect bright people, willing to roll up their sleeves, take on new assignments, and juggle many things at once.</p><br/>
<p></p>
<p>
In return for your hard work, you'll have an opportunity to work at one of the fastest growing and creative technology companies around, as well as help us promote a life-changing product and develop a world-class team every day. In our down time we have ping pong and corn hole (or ""bags,"" depending on where you're from) tournaments. However, the pace is pretty quick around here, so you'll need to be prepared to keep up.</p>
<p><b>
JOB DESCRIPTION</b></p>
<p>
The Customer Advocate role is a unique combination of a few different things but long story short, you'll be the face of Carvana. Since Carvana's purchase process is entirely online, meeting you to receive their newly purchased vehicle will likely be the first time a customer has met a Carvana employee face-to-face! You'll have the freedom to go above and beyond to ensure our customers have an experience that doesn't suck and is completely one of a kind.</p>
<p><b>
SPECIFICALLY, YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES WILL INCLUDE:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Delivering a uniquely special experience to each and every one of our customers. Minus the red suit, you'll pretty much be a real-life Santa Claus on a daily basis!</li>
<li>A major part of this job is driving a kick-ass single-car hauler to get the customer's purchase delivered straight to their front door. You don't need a commercial driver's license to drive the hauler and don't worry, with a little training, you'll realize driving the hauler is a piece of cake.</li>
<li>Not only will you be driving that kick-ass car hauler, but you will also be loading and unloading the customer's vehicle on and off of it (it's a quick and easy process, but it does require getting a little physical) and inspecting the car-hauler to ensure the vehicle maintains good maintenance and safe driving conditions.</li>
<li>You'll be expected to prioritize safe driving and to maintain a clean driving record in accordance to Carvana's CMV Driver Qualification policy. Consistent, safe driving is crucial to this role!</li>
<li>You will be accurately and efficiently completing customer paperwork as well as taking thorough notes in our customer tracking system. Again, don't worry, we'll train you on the paperwork, however you do need a natural eye for detail!</li>
<li>You'll also be a team player by assisting other team members with various tasks as necessary.</li>
<li>Like we mentioned, the Customer Advocate role is a unique combination of a few different things. So there likely will be other duties assigned too.</li>
</ul>

<p>
At Carvana, we sell cars, but we're not salespeople. Since 2013, we've been making it our mission to change the way people buy cars. We saw a huge problem with how much it can suck to buy a car the traditional way, so we committed ourselves to tackling one of the largest, yet-to-be-disrupted markets in the world – the $1T per year U.S. car market (yes, that's $Trillion with a ""T"").</p>
<p>
With the ability to search thousands of vehicles from our expansive inventory, to high-resolution 360° photographs of our vehicles' interior and exterior, to real-time financing and the ability to complete contracts without visiting the back room of a dealership, we provide a seamless, online car buying experience for consumers that can be completed from their desktop or mobile device. All our vehicles are inspected and reconditioned based on our 150-point certification checklist and come with a 7-day return policy. We also operate our own logistics network to deliver cars to customers as soon as the next day, as well as offer customer pick-up at our state-of-the-art Car Vending Machine locations (yes, you read that right). By putting customer satisfaction at the core of our business, we've built a no-pressure, no-haggle online car buying experience that save our customers time and money.</p>

We expect bright people, willing to roll up their sleeves, take on new assignments, and juggle many things at once.</p><br/>
<p></p>
<p>
In return for your hard work, you'll have an opportunity to work at one of the fastest growing and creative technology companies around, as well as help us promote a life-changing product and develop a world-class team every day. In our down time we have ping pong and corn hole (or ""bags,"" depending on where you're from) tournaments. However, the pace is pretty quick around here, so you'll need to be prepared to keep up.</p>
<p><b>
JOB DESCRIPTION</b></p>
<p>
The Customer Advocate role is a unique combination of a few different things but long story short, you'll be the face of Carvana. Since Carvana's purchase process is entirely online, meeting you to receive their newly purchased vehicle will likely be the first time a customer has met a Carvana employee face-to-face! You'll have the freedom to go above and beyond to ensure our customers have an experience that doesn't suck and is completely one of a kind.</p>
<p><b>
SPECIFICALLY, YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES WILL INCLUDE:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Delivering a uniquely special experience to each and every one of our customers. Minus the red suit, you'll pretty much be a real-life Santa Claus on a daily basis!</li>
<li>A major part of this job is driving a kick-ass single-car hauler to get the customer's purchase delivered straight to their front door. You don't need a commercial driver's license to drive the hauler and don't worry, with a little training, you'll realize driving the hauler is a piece of cake.</li>
<li>Not only will you be driving that kick-ass car hauler, but you will also be loading and unloading the customer's vehicle on and off of it (it's a quick and easy process, but it does require getting a little physical) and inspecting the car-hauler to ensure the vehicle maintains good maintenance and safe driving conditions.</li>
<li>You'll be expected to prioritize safe driving and to maintain a clean driving record in accordance to Carvana's CMV Driver Qualification policy. Consistent, safe driving is crucial to this role!</li>
<li>You will be accurately and efficiently completing customer paperwork as well as taking thorough notes in our customer tracking system. Again, don't worry, we'll train you on the paperwork, however you do need a natural eye for detail!</li>
<li>You'll also be a team player by assisting other team members with various tasks as necessary.</li>
<li>Like we mentioned, the Customer Advocate role is a unique combination of a few different things. So there likely will be other duties assigned too.</li>
</ul>
